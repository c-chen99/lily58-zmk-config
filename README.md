Installing updated firmware:
Plug in one side nice!nano to your computer.
Enter the bootloader by double-tapping the reset button. (You can skip this if you haven't flashed the nice!nano before)
Drag and drop the left or right .uf2 file onto the NICENANO drive or copy it with your terminal.
After flashing is complete, the drive will disappear and the nice!nano will reboot. May pop up an error about interrupted actions.

Installing settings reset firmware:
Put each half of the split keyboard into bootloader mode.
Flash one of the halves of the split with the settings reset firmware.
Repeat step 2 with the other half of the split keyboard.
Flash the actual image for each half of the split keyboard (e.g my_board_left.uf2 to the left half, my_board_right.uf2 to the right half).
